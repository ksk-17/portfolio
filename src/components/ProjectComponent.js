        "Fine-tuned the microsoft/phi-2 model on the DialogSum dataset using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters for efficient parameter tuning. Achieved a 13.39% improvement in ROUGE score, enhancing summarization accuracy and contextual fluency. Demonstrated scalable fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific LLM applications.",

        "Built a CycleGAN model from scratch using PyTorch for unpaired image-to-image translation between landscape photos and Monet-style artworks. Implemented adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses for stable training and style preservation. Achieved a MiFID score of 69.25, validating the modelâ€™s ability to generalize and mimic artistic patterns.",
